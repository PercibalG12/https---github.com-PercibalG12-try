        <h3>Reflection on the Test</h3>
        <p>The test states that I am 66% materialistic which means I am oriented towards wanting to be attractive and
            impressive to others. Often externally
            narcissistic, seeking to be whatever the external world deems best. I find this take to inaccurate as these
            are things i rarely care about.</p>
